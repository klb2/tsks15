  This courseâ€¯treats statistical signal processing, specifically parameter
  estimation and detection of signals. The purpose of the course is to provide
  a solid foundation in algorithms, models, methods and theory for the
  extraction of information from noisy signals. Applications are found for
  example within radar systems, communications systems, positioning systems and
  image analysis.
prerequisites:
  - Linear algebra
  - Probability theory
  - General mathematical maturity and understanding of electrical/systems engineering
  - Programming skills (Python or Matlab)
review:
  - Vectors, matrices, transpose, inverse, determinant, positive (semi-)definite forms, ...
  - Vector-valued random variables, (multivariate) Gaussian distributions
  - Mean and covariance, statistical independence
  - Conditional and marginal probability, Bayes rule
